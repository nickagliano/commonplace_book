# Data Structures

The data structure that inspired my deeper exploration of data structures was the [Quadtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree).

What a beautiful structure!

I was actually watching [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA11Zpggtp4), which is a mock interview, released by a company called "interviewing.io". In it, the interviewee must solve a "K Nearest Restaurants" problem. Long story short, he sort of intuits the quadtree data structure, and it's really, really fascinating to watch. So fascinating, that it inspired me to become more knowledgable on data structures!

I'm not going to cover every single data structure, but probably a couple of the classics, and then a couple more obscure (i.e., quadtree), or any that really strike my curiousity.
