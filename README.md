# Commonplace Book

This is my ([Nick Agliano](https://nickagliano.com/)'s) digital, open-source commonplace book.

> [Commonplace books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) are a way to compile knowledge, usually by writing information into books. They have been kept from antiquity, and were kept particularly during the Renaissance and in the nineteenth century. Such books are similar to scrapbooks filled with items of many kinds: notes, proverbs, adages, aphorisms, maxims, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, prayers, legal formulas, and recipes.

I don't know what shape this will eventually take. But, at least in the beginning, this commonplace book will primarily be focused on:
1) Programming
2) Writing I do on [Slam Dunk Software](https://slamdunksoftware.substack.com/)

So, think, list of programming idioms, heruistics, opinions, useful links, tools, tech history, and anything else I think makes sense to put here.
